# Image-Captioning
It is the implementation of a soft attention based Image Caption Generator. It is based on widely used Encoder-Decoder Framework, where the encoder is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the decoder has long short-term memory(LSTM) architecture. This repository uses [ResNet-50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model pretrained on dataset for encoding.
